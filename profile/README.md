## Overview

**Relief Mapper** is a software application designed to easily create, edit and export high-quality terrain relief maps from digital elevation models (DEMs). Ideal for cartographers, engineers, designers and hobbyists, it offers tools for terrain visualization, 3D model preparation, textured mapping and export in multiple formats for printing, interactive presentation or analysis.

---

## Key Features

- 📥 Import elevation models (DEMs), satellite imagery and map layers.  
- 🌍 Convert elevation data into full 3D terrain with zoom, rotate and pan controls.  
- 🎨 Apply textures and styles: satellite images, elevation colour gradients or stylised textures.  
- 🖨 Export to **OBJ**, **STL**, **GLTF** or high-resolution PNG for print or web use.  
- 🧩 Prepare models for 3D printing or CNC manufacturing: mesh optimisation included.  
- 📊 Add labels, markers and GIS overlays for enhanced cartographic output.

---

## Advanced Features

- 🔁 Batch processing and automation workflows.  
- ☀️ Custom lighting and shadow controls for realistic terrain appearance.  
- 🧠 Save style profiles and project settings for reuse.  
- 🔧 Support for professional GIS and 3D formats and large-scale terrain regions.  
- 🏞 Handle large terrain datasets with high detail.

---

## Ideal For

- Cartographers visualizing landscape relief and terrain features.  
- Survey and civil engineers modelling terrain for site planning.  
- Hobbyists and makers 3D-printing local terrain models.  
- Educational institutions teaching terrain mapping and 3D modeling.
